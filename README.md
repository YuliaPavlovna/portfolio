I'm a frontend developer (JavaScript | React.js | Python | Web3.js | Ethers.js), which could build interactive experiences for web applications and solve any challenging problem that occur. I am an old hand in developing responsible layouts from scratch using modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, Python and JavaScript framework (React or Vue).
